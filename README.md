Animal Farm

Welcome to the my Animal Farm project! This simple Java program is designed to help me solidify basic Java concepts such as inheritance, getters and setters, constructors, conditionals, loops, and other foundational elements of the Java programming language.

Introduction

The Animal Farm program simulates a small farm with different types of animals. Each animal has unique characteristics and behaviors. The program demonstrates how to create and manage these animals using fundamental Java concepts.
Features

    Create and manage different types of animals
    Demonstrate inheritance by extending a base Animal class
    Use getters and setters to access and modify animal properties
    Implement constructors to initialize objects
    Use conditionals and loops to control program flow

Concepts Covered

The program covers the following Java concepts:

    Inheritance: Learn how to create a class hierarchy by extending a base class.
    Getters and Setters: Understand how to access and modify private fields using getters and setters.
    Constructors: Learn how to initialize objects with constructors.
    Conditionals: Use if, else if, and else statements to make decisions.
    Loops: Implement loops (for, while, and do-while) to repeat actions.
    Basic I/O: Use basic input and output to interact with the user.
